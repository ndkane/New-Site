		<p>Hi, I’m Natalie, and I live and work in Brighton, UK. I’m a web designer and developer, digital consultant, artist and visual arts curator.</p>

		<p>I was taught my craft by Aral Balkan, who, aside from teaching me everything I know about web design and development, showed me the ways of Indie Web, being semantic, and always writing good copy.</p>

		<p>I love digital culture, and have recently become very interested in the future of culture, digital and technology. In fact I’ve started rambling about it in public now over on <a href='http://medium.com/futures-exchange'>Futures Exchange.</a>

		<h2 class='section'>What I can offer you</h2>

			<h3>Digital Consultancy and Web Design for small businesses, creatives and designers.</h3> 
			<p class="skills">I’ll work to make sure your online presence properly represents your work, branding and values. I can offer web design and development, and set you up with a CMS so it's easy for you to update your site. I’ll also look at your social media presence, and see where we can improve it.</p>
			<h3>Curation and Project Management in Visual Arts.</h3>
			<p class="skills">I have experience curating, planning, running and budgeting for exhibitions and arts projects. I ran Blank Slate, a Brighton based organisation bringing contemporary art to the public. Our inaugural exhibition reached an audience of over 1500 people in Brighton City Centre. I’ll make sure everything from site, to staffing, to the books are prepared so that you can concentrate on your work. As an artist, I understand that the relationship between the institution and your practise must be open, honest, and fair, so I’ll be working to make sure that everything is transparent and crystal clear.</p>

			<h3 class="contact">If you’d like to work with me, drop me <a href="mailto:hello@ndkane.com">a line</a>, or say hello on <a href="http://twitter.com/nd_kane">Twitter.</a></h3>
